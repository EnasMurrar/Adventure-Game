Find the Smurfs' Secret Village game
It is a game that I made using the Python language and in the pycodestyle style
You will face many challenges and excitement as there are initially 3 options in front of you and every path you will take will have new events and possibilities that may be useful and help you reach the village or may lead you to lose and exit the game. The important thing is to be careful and choose carefully and expect what is not expected
